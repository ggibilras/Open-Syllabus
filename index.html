		<div class="threecol"> <h3> Why are we discussing about syllabus? </h3> </div>
		<div class="ninecol last"> We are asking ourselves if a classic and standard syllabus is the right tool for today’s education and if it is not, how we can push further the idea of a contemporary syllabus.</div>
	</div>




	<div class="row">
		<div class="threecol"> <h3> What a syllabus provides you? </h3> </div>
		<div class="ninecol last"> A syllabus is a document. It is  generally printed and up to a dozen pages, it is often produced by an instructor and includes a course’s most basic information: time and location, schedule, learning objectives, grading, rules for conduct in class, introductory text, reference figures and imagery, and an overview of the course’s readings and assignments.</div>
	</div>




	<div class="row">
		<div class="threecol"> <h3> Is it syllabus an outdated format in nowadays education? </h3> </div>
		<div class="ninecol last"> Education today is no more characterized by a static and univocal relation between teacher and students. Specially in the design field. Giving to students a syllabus at the beginning of a course is useful, but often programs and methods change during the course. Today we need a flexible tool to keep trace of these changes to provide students a consistent teaching.

		<div class="ninecol last"> 
			<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13990214/montessori.jpeg"></img><br><br>
			Open learning is a teaching method that is, among others, founded on the work of Célestin Freinet in France and Maria Montessori in Italy. Open learning is supposed to allow pupils self-determined, independent and interest-guided learning - source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_learning">wikipedia</a>. But this is not the only way how we consider and define open learning. From our point of view open learning is also the possibility to access educational content without any obstacle. Everyone could learn without any kind of hierarchy as they could be university taxes. A good example is <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. A digital blackboard and the voice of Salman Khan (founder) represent all the necessary to spread knowledge all over the work. And this seems to really work. Here an example of lecture.<br><br>

		<div class="threecol"> <h3> Why a syllabus should be open? </h3> </div>
		<div class="ninecol last"> 
			Usually a syllabus is a document provided by a teacher for the students. So, it is accessible only for the course attenders. Giving this documentation widely and freely can spread knowledge and course schedules that could help new realities such as temporary schools, workshops and experimental educational schools. We would like to mention a very interesting project. The <a href="http://www.escola-aberta-rio.com/en/">Escola Aberta</a> was a temporary design school in Rio de Janeiro, from the 6th till the 11th of August 2012.
			Directed at students, young professionals and artists, the Escola Aberta aimed to ignite a discussion on ways of practising and teaching design. Its main intention was to encourage the exchange of ideas between the Netherlands and Brazil, raising questions and opening a contemplative arena rather than offering definite solutions.

		<img src="http://www.manystuff.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/MaketheLivingLookDeadTheShowroom2012BWscommission.161331.jpg" /><br>
		One of the most interesting benefit is the possibility to compare different results based on the same syllabus. For example we think is important to see how different realities react in different situations, different amount of time, different project/course leaders, different students/participants and so on.
